## 30 Days of Front-End Webpages

A personal project of mine, where I spend 30 days practicing and exploring front-end features, ranging from unconventional navigation flows, responsive design, CSS animations, jQuery effects, modals, carousels, and more. I create **very** simple static webpages, which could act as templates for future applications.
